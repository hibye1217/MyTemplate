# MyTemplate
PS Template for me.
It's for reading purpose, not for using purpose.
Also I didn't test these code so use it for your own risk.

## Currently...
- Main
    - solving.cpp: Template for PS
    - solving2.cpp: Another template for PS (Not Finished)
    - competitive.cpp: Template for CP
    - additional.cpp: Additional template
